        Forest fire frequency is increasing globally with the significant
        incidents occurring in Asia (Giglio et al. 2006). Wildfires have major
        environmental and ecological issues (Zhang et al. 2016), threaten
        human lives (Bowman et al. 2009), causing massive losses of lives and
        properties (Russell-Smith et al. 2007). Satellite data can help detect
        forest fires in different land use (Kaufman et al. 1998; Justice et
        al. 2006) and the Geographical Information System (GIS) and remote
        sensing techniques have been used widely to assess and predict the
        fire frequency (Roy et al. 2002; Giglio et al. 2006; Abedi Gheshlaghi
        et al. 2020). Assessment of the integrated spatial-temporal pattern of
        hazardous natural events is essential in disaster risk management,
        however, this aspect is often neglected (Loboda and Csiszar 2007;
        Middendorp et al. 2013), and majority of the studies consider these
        two dimensions separately. The MODIS satellite exploits middle
        infrared and thermal infrared bands to identify thermal anomalies and
        generate fire locations and has relatively better accuracy (Roy et al.
        2002; Pereira et al. 2017). Fire-risk maps are widely developed in
        many countries at coarse resolution using wildland fuel models or
        vegetation maps (Chuvieco et al. 2004; Hessburg et al. 2007) as an
        early warning precaution. Fire risk zone is an area where fires are
        likely to occur that might impact other places as well (Jaiswal et al.
        2002 ; Erten et al. 2004). An accurate risk zone mapping is essential
        to abate the possible effects of fires in the forest (Jaiswal et al.
        2002). TAL and CHAL are two significant landscapes in Nepal and are
        considered to be Asia's important biodiversity ecoregion. Forest fires
        are one of the major ecological threats that affect different regions
        of these landscapes annually, mainly in the pre-monsoon season (WWF
        Nepal 2017 ). The main objective of this study was to identify where
        and when are the fire most likely to occur. This is crucial to
        understand the factors associated with forest fires and for planning
        strategies to reduce forest fires, to control and manage the sources
        of ignition, and to identify areas at risk (Leone et al. 2003;
        Koutsias et al. 2016; Parajuli and Haynes 2015). Developing an
        integrated forest fire risk zone can therefore be helpful in deciding
        the problems taking into account of the human and biophysical factors.
